# Create a simple webpage with a micro interaction using TailwindCSS and ensure it's fully responsive.

# Steps:

1. Create HTML elements for the main content, such as a container, header, and footer.
2. Style these elements using TailwindCSS classes to establish a basic layout.
3. Choose a micro interaction effect (e.g., hover animation for a button - changes color or size)
4. Utilize TailwindCSS's responsive modifiers (e.g., sm:, md:, lg:) to adjust styles based on screen size.
5. Test your website on different devices and screen sizes to ensure it adapts properly.
