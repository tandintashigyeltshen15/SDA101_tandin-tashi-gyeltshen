# Exercise 2 - Basic form validation

Implement client-side form validation using Vanilla JavaScript.
Your goal is to make sure the form checks for valid user input in real-time (as the user types), without reloading the page.

What Youâ€™ll Build
A simple registration form with the following fields:

1. Username
2. Email
3. Password
4. Confirm Password

# Step 1: Create the HTML form
Create a basic HTML form containing:

<input> fields for username, email, password, and confirm password.
A Submit button.
Give each input field a unique id so you can easily access them in JavaScript.

# Step 2: Connect JavaScript to your HTML
Link your JavaScript file at the end of the <body> section:
<script src="script.js"></script>

# Step 3: Add real-time validation
Use JavaScript to check each field as the user types (input event).

Validation Rules
Field	              Validation Rule
Username	          Must be at least 3 characters long
Email	              Must follow correct email format (e.g., someone@example.com)
Password	          Must include:
                      - Minimum 8 characters
                      - At least one uppercase letter
                      - At least one lowercase letter
                      - At least one special character (e.g., @, #, $, %)
Confirm Password	  Must match the password field

# Step 4: Show error messages dynamically
Use DOM manipulation to display helpful messages below each input field.
Example:
usernameError.textContent = "Username must be at least 3 characters long";

# Step 5: Disable the Submit button until all fields are valid
Initially, keep the Submit button disabled.
Only enable it when all validations pass.
Example Logic

if (allFieldsAreValid) {
  submitButton.disabled = false;
} else {
  submitButton.disabled = true;
}

Step 6: (Optional) Style your form

Use CSS to make:
* Error messages appear in red.
* Valid inputs have green borders.
